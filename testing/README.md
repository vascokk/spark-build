# Testing utils

Common python code used for integration testing of services in this repository. By convention the libraries in this directory tend to start with `sdk_`, making them a little easier to identify in individual tests.

Each service has its own tests which use these common utilities. For example, see the [../frameworks/helloworld/tests/](hello-world service tests).
